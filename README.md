# Password Generator, Module-3-Challenge

    In this assignment I created a custom password generator.
    Using Javascript this password gnenerator allows the user
    to decide what types of characters they would like to
    include in their password. The user is able to decide the
    password length and whether or not to include characters
    such as: numbers, lower case, upper case and special characters.
    This application is extremely simple to use and each password
    is completely randomized.
